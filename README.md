# Kenzie Academy Challenge: Dates and Times

Follow the instructions provided on `my.kenzie.academy` for this challenge. The `code.js` file is a placeholder. Feel free to rename it or add additional files to the project.

Customize this README.md however you want to turn it into documentation for your project (including deleting these opening paragraphs). The only required section is **Reflection** (and the **Project Plan** if you complete the Advanced Level), but if you used a unit testing framework, also fill in the **Running the Unit Tests** section. Be sure to use proper Markdown syntax in this file (here's a [cheatsheet PDF](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf) of the basic syntax).

## Running the Unit Tests (Basic and Intermediate Levels Only)

_(Instructions for how to install the unit testing framework and run the unit tests.)_

## Project Plan (Advanced Level Only)

_(Put your project plan here. It could be pseudocode, an outline-style development plan, etc. But whatever form you choose, it should be detailed enough that another developer could feasibly use it to implement your solution.)_

## Reflection

### Basic and Intermediate Levels Only

For a software developer, what are the benefits of good unit tests? Are there any drawbacks to writing unit tests?

The benefits of a good unit test is that it allows me to discover edge cases that I may not initially consider. For example, when finding the difference between 2 dates, I noticed that if there was over a 12 hour difference between the times, then I would not get the the correct difference, and without unit tests, I would not have allowed me to notice that nor would it be simple to figure out the solution to the problem.

### Advanced Level Only

What different approaches or techniques did you consider when planning your implementation? What were the advantages and disadvantages of those alternatives?

_(Put your reflection answer here.)_
